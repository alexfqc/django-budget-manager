## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository and start the containers:

### Create the .env file at root folder and add this code:

```bash
POSTGRES_DB=budget_db
POSTGRES_USER=user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
DEBUG=True
POSTGRES_HOST=db
CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND=redis://redis:6379/0
```

### Open your terminal, go to your project folder and run

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Open a new tab an run migrations:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate
```

### Create fake data:

```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py seed_test_data
```

### Go back to first tab where you ran:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

And you'll be able to see celery logs with schedule tasks:
